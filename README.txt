My work for the Advent of Code challenge for 2022. 
Most of the days were done solely by me with no outside help, a few of the later days required some insight from other solutions. A good learning experience regardless.
Solutions are unoptimized for space/runtime.

Notable days which required some amount of outside assistance.
Day 11 - Had a small but compounding issue with the modular arithmetic which I was only able to catch and resolve after reading through hints for the day on the AoC subreddit. 
Day 15 P2 - Super close to the solution. had the correct logic of only checking the borders of the diamond shapes for the single open square, but had issues coding the loops in a manner to cut down runtime of the checks.
Day 17 - I had an error that I could not figure out. I ended up checking my input using someone elses solution and found that it was an off by one error.
Day 18 P2 - Off by multiple of 6, I likely had a large enough air pocket that was not fully accounted for.


Day 16, 19, and 22 felt a little beyond my scope in knowledge at the time, so I am slowly learning and working on a solution for those.
Day 17 is currently ungoing some revision - I was able to get the right answer but I had to do it in a vastly different manner after getting some help online.
I believe my original method could solve it so I am trying to make it work.
