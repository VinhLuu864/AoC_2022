My work for the Advent of Code challenge for 2022. 
Most of the days were done solely by me with no outside help, a few of the later days required some insight from other solutions. A good learning experience regardless.
Most solutions are unoptimized for space/runtime.

Notable days which required some amount of outside assistance.
Day 11 - Had a small but compounding issue with the modular arithmetic which I was only able to catch and resolve after reading through hints for the day on the AoC subreddit. 
Day 15 P2 - Super close to the solution. had the correct logic of only checking the borders of the diamond shapes for the single open square, but had issues coding the loops in a manner to cut down runtime of the checks.
Day 17 - I had an error that I could not figure out. I ended up checking my input using someone elses solution and found that it was an off by one error.
